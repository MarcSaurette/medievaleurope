# Faith and Learning

### Goals for this week

This week we will explore the link between religion and education in the medieval world, in particular exploring the link between literacy and education in Christianity and Islam during the early Middle Ages.

* we will return to the question of sources - by looking at a early medieval letter exchanged between an abbess and a Frankish queen. We will take a look at print editions of the letter as well as the manuscript on which the edition is based. 
* you will learn about the types of editions that medieval historians use and how that affects how we can use primary sources

### **Online Time**

In class on Tuesday, November 17th, the professor will talk about the role of religion in what Rosenwein calls the three Sibiling Cultures, as well as discuss how Wickham sees the link of religion and politics. We will then spend the second half of the class discussing a letter written from Abbess Caesaria to Queen Radegund. To understand what medieval sources look like, we will read the letter, discuss its meaning and also look at what the original Latin manuscript looks like. 

### Read/Watch/Listen

* Chapters 8 & 17 in Chris Wickham's _Inheritance of Rome_ on Perusall. 
* Joan M. Ferrante, biographical entry on ‘[Caesaria, abbess of Arles’](https://epistolae.ctl.columbia.edu/woman/25209.html), _Epistolae: Medieval Women’s Latin Letters_. New York: Columbia University, 2014 \(posted on Perusall\).
* Professor Ferrante’s edition and translation of [Caesaria’s letter to Radegund](https://epistolae.ctl.columbia.edu/letter/915.html).
* Compare her text to the original Latin edition in the [Monumenta Germanie Historica](https://www.dmgh.de/mgh_epp_3/index.htm#page/450/mode/1up) from which Joan Ferrante's draws for her translation. This is to give you a sense of what scholarly editions look like. 
* Look through a B&W version of the letter in a medieval manuscript \(posted on Perusall or downloadable below\). Try to match the Latin text you can find in the files above, with the text in the handwritten manuscript \(below\).

### Practice

[Transcription Exercise:](../exercises/transcription-exercise.md) 

* follow along Ferrante's Latin text provided in the manuscript
* Catalogue description of manuscript \(in French\) is here: [https://ccfr.bnf.fr/portailccfr/ark:/06871/004D02A14154](https://ccfr.bnf.fr/portailccfr/ark:/06871/004D02A14154)

Bibliography and a link to a B&W reproduction of the manuscript is available [here](https://portail.mediatheque.grand-troyes.fr/iguana/www.main.cls?surl=search#RecordId=2.2094). This viewer is somewhat antequated and only works on some browsers \(it uses Flash\), so I have added a pdf version of the first few pages and the letter to Radegund on Persuall.  

### **Discuss**

What questions should students be discussing in their annotations?

1. Based on the Caesaria of Arles letter, what were the possibilities and limitations of monastic life for early medieval women?

* What might this letter tell us about Merovingian women’s literacy?
* What is asceticism? How is it depicted in this letter?

### **Do**

Students should be working on revising their Draft document analysis. 

### Going Further

If students want to do more to ensure success, what materials and resources \(e.g. reading, video, audio simulations, games\) do you recommend?

* look at the documentaries linked above for different takes on our topic from Western Europe, Islamic Iberia \(Al-Aldalus\) and Africa.
