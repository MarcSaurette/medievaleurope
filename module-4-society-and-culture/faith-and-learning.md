# Faith and Learning

### Goals for this week

By the end of this week, what should students **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

### Practice

Are there practical activities \(tasks, labs, fieldwork\), which students must do this week? If so, what are they and what specifically do they need to do, bearing in mind social-distancing?

Draw a monastery activity: [https://lochinbrouillard.wordpress.com/2019/11/06/class-activity-draw-a-monastery/](https://lochinbrouillard.wordpress.com/2019/11/06/class-activity-draw-a-monastery/)

Transcription Exercise: follow along Ferrante's Latin text provided in the manuscript??? Catalogue description of ms is here: [https://ccfr.bnf.fr/portailccfr/ark:/06871/004D02A14154](https://ccfr.bnf.fr/portailccfr/ark:/06871/004D02A14154)

Bibliography and a link to a B&W reproduction of the manuscript is available [here](https://portail.mediatheque.grand-troyes.fr/iguana/www.main.cls?surl=search#RecordId=2.2094). 

### **Discuss**

What questions should students be discussing with each other?

1. Based on the Caesaria of Arles letter, what were the possibilities and limitations of monastic life for early medieval women?

* What might this letter tell us about Merovingian women’s literacy?
* What is asceticism? How is it depicted in this letter?

### **Do**

What quizzes \(if any\) or other activities should students complete this week to evaluate their own progress? How will they know they are “on track”?

### **Assess** 

Is there a graded assignment this week? If so, what is the assignment and when does it need to be submitted?

### Going Further

If students want to do more to ensure success, what materials and resources \(e.g. reading, video, audio simulations, games\) do you recommend?

### **Help**

 If a student is struggling, how should they seek help?
