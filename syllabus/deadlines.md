# Deadlines

For this class to work, especially in an online environment, everyone needs to get all work completed on time. Since the assignments are designed to build on each other and there needs to be enough time to move from one assignment to the next, there is almost no margin for delay. So, in sum, get your work in on time.

### Extensions and Accommodations

The current university policy for asking for special extensions due to illness is available from the Registrar's office, which has a COVID-19 self-declaration form \([https://carleton.ca/registrar/wp-content/uploads/COVID-19\_Self-declaration.pdf](https://carleton.ca/registrar/wp-content/uploads/COVID-19_Self-declaration.pdf)\). Students can use it to ask for deferral/extensions for term work.  Students can submit this form, instead of having to get a doctorâ€™s note.

As far as I am concerned, you do not need to give me \(Marc Saurette\) a doctor's note or a self-declaration form. You can just let me know if problems or illnesses have arisen and we can discuss timelines and strategies for you to complete your work. If you have been sick and this has delayed you from completing work, please let me know sooner rather than later so that we can work with you to come up with a new plan/ timeline. I understand that illness can mess up you intended work timeline, so the more information I know, the more I can help you plan.
