# Deadlines

For this class to work, especially in an online environment, everyone needs to get all work completed on time. Since the assignments are designed to build on each other and there needs to be enough time to move from one assignment to the next, there is almost no margin for delay. So, in sum, get your work in on time. 

### Important Dates

| Assignment | Date due |
| :--- | :--- |
| cuPortfolio profile | 4pm Friday of week 2 \(September 25\) |
| Critical reflection no. 1 | 4pm Friday of week 4 \(October 9\) |
| Critical reflection no. 2 | 4pm Friday of week 12 \(December 4\) |
| Draft Document Analysis | 10am Monday of week 7 \(November 2\) |
| Peer Feedback | 4pm Friday of week 9 \(November 13\) |
| Rewritten Document Analysis | 4pm Friday of week 11 \(November 27\) |
| Process Letter | 4pm Friday of week 13 \(December 11\) |

\*The "end of the week" is understood to be by 4pm on Fridays. The sole exception is the deadline for the Draft Document Analysis, which will be due at 10am on Monday, November 2 \(the Monday after reading week\). This deadline is very important so that your work can be read by your peers and given feedback. 

### Extensions and Accommodations

The current university policy for asking for special extensions due to illness is available from the Registrar's office, which has a COVID-19 self-declaration form \([https://carleton.ca/registrar/wp-content/uploads/COVID-19\_Self-declaration.pdf](https://carleton.ca/registrar/wp-content/uploads/COVID-19_Self-declaration.pdf)\). Students can use it to ask for deferral/extensions for term work.  Students can submit this form, instead of having to get a doctorâ€™s note.

As far as I am concerned, you do not need to give me \(Marc Saurette\) a doctor's note or a self-declaration form. You can just let me know if problems or illnesses have arisen and we can discuss timelines and strategies for you to complete your assignments. If you have been sick and this has delayed you from completing work, please let me know sooner rather than later so that we can work with you to come up with a new plan/ timeline. I understand that illness can mess up your intended work timeline, so the more information I know, the more I can help you plan.
