# Process Letter

At the end of first term, students will write process letters, describing their learning and how their work evolved over the term. It should be a reflection on your work, including links to examples of work you find most representative \(even work that you don't otherwise turn in\).

### What do I need to include?

The goal is for you to make an argument for the overall grade you will propose for yourself. I provide here guiding questions that should be taken into account to provide evidence/ justification for your suggested grade. 

1. Outside of class time, how much time did you spend on the class each week?
2. Describe how you spent this time and offer, if possible, a breakdown of time spent on different activities \(i.e. socializing/texting, plotting, researching, reading, writing\).
3. Describe your major contribution to the class?
4. What are you really proud of doing or getting accomplished in class? Why?
5. What is the one thing that you would like to change about how you played? Why?
6. Consider what you did in the class compared to what you thought you would be doing when we began in September. What do you see as the most important thing about early medieval society that you learned in class?
7. Reflect on what you learned in the class as a whole. List any skills, methods or techniques that you have acquired or additional knowledge you gained.
8. What else would you have liked to learn in order to be better prepared for the class? I.E. If you could go back in time to the beginning of the course, knowing what you know now about the experience, what piece of advice would you offer? What do you wish you knew then?
9. Identify someone in class who helped you to do/ produce better work than you expected. Describe how they helped you.
10. Describe if and how you helped someone else in class with their work or gameplay. 
11. Identify one person whom you would categorize as an student and explain how/why.
12. One purpose of the class is to help students to develop better collaborative and leadership skills. Part of this is identifying oneâ€™s own strengths and weaknesses in this regard while also realizing what makes an effective working group and what does not.

Some of the things that are being important for a successful group effort are as follows:

* Being prepared for lecture/ tutorials
* Being open-minded and a good listener 
* Helping each other
* Meeting outside of class to strategize and prepare 
* Being organized
