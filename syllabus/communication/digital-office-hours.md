# Digital Office Hours

I consider it very important for students to have direct access to the professor. Getting to know your prof \(and be known by them\) is an important part of being a successful students. We want to make sure that –even though you can't drop by our office for a cup of tea– you can still have the opportunity to meet up when you want to. 

### How to attend office hours

I'll have office hours each week on Wednesday afternoons after class. 

We can meet one-on-one via [Teams](../../digital-tools/teams/). I'll have a standing meeting which you can see recorded in the Calendar integrated into the Teams software. Just as you click to join class each week, you'll click to join the office hours meeting. Instead of it being the whole class together, however, I will admit people into the discussion on a person-by-person basis. 

I think they'll be a sign up sheet somewhere....
