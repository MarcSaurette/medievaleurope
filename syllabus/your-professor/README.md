# Your Professors

Hi! We want to introduce ourselves as the professors of _Medieval Europe_ \(HIST2000\). 

Our purpose \(as the professors\) is to act as your contact person, academic guide and tutor \(as well as a medieval specialist\). We will teach you content \(i.e. facts about the past\), but also will help you to figure out how to go about being a university student, especially when these days we're experimenting with what "being a university student" means. 

You can get in contact with us:

Communication during online classes or directly with the professors is actively encouraged. During class students should feel welcome to ask questions \(by voice or text chat\), request clarifications and express their thoughts. Discussion and an exchange of views are the keystones of learning.

Please remember that meeting with the professor via MS Teams during assigned office hours is often the best way to resolve your concerns, questions and queries quickly. If it is impossible to meet up online during assigned times, get in touch with your professor to figure out an alterate time. Understand that we may not receive messages left late in the day or on the weekend, nor are we always free to respond immediately.
