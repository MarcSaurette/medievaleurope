# Anatomy of an Academic Article

In this exercise, we will again be using hypothes.is to jointly annotate, but this time it will be an academic article.

This week our theme is "Where is the Middle Ages" and our article attempts to grapple with the idea of whether we can see the Middle Ages as a global phenomenon - i.e. not limited only to what we now consider Europe. 

This article is written for specialists and so might take some time to make sense of, even if its purpose is relatively straightforward. 

### Our text
