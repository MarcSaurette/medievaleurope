# Supplemental Material

Given the online nature of the course, I want to provide students with additional resources that they can use \(optional!\) to help their learning and round out the material presented to you. I'll add stuff here, or maybe on Perusall?



### Online lectures/ podcasts:

If in-person classes are cancelled and you really like the lecture format \(i.e. listening to an expert talk\), you can [watch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL77A337915A76F660) or [listen to](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/itunes-u/early-middle-ages/id515946405) lectures for the course, _The Early Middle Ages, 234-1000_, given by a fantastic historian, Paul Freedman \(He's also written some great stuff on the history of food\).

If you are looking for some narrative history about the Byzantine Empire in Middle Ages, check out _The History of Byzantium Podcast._ It has a [website](https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com) with supplemental materials or the podcasts can be downloaded from [itunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-history-of-byzantium/id527579475) and other sites.
