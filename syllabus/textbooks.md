# Textbooks

Given the uncertainty about how much campus will be open this fall, we have not ordered a textbook to the campus bookstore for students to purchase. Instead, we have stuck with textbooks from a Canadian publisher \(University of Toronto Press\), which means that you can easily get books delivered directly to where you are \(or download ebook versions for slightly less\) without paying customs duties...

### Our textbooks: 

Barbara Rosenwein, [_A Short History of the Middle Ages_](https://utorontopress.com/ca/a-short-history-of-the-middle-ages-fifth-edition-2)_._ 5th edition. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2018. ISBN 9781442636224

Barbara Rosewein, ed.[ Reading the Middle Ages](https://utorontopress.com/us/reading-the-middle-ages-10). 3rd edition. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2018. ISBN 9781442636736

We choose these textbooks because Rosenwein provides an up-to-date account of the medieval world and provides a diverse range of sources in the companion volume.  They are printed on good quality paper and have loads of illustrations and maps. Since HIST 2000 is a full-year course, we are using the "combined editions". 

### How to Get Textbooks

If you click on the links in the textbook titles \(above\), it will take you directly to the UTP website where you can buy them. Ebook versions will run you over 110$ \(54+57$\) and paperback will be about 140$ \(67+70$\). You can also buy these books from other places, such as [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org) \(which allows you to order new books from local independent booksellers\) or used from [AbeBooks](https://www.abebooks.com) \(which started out as a Canadian company \[Advanced Book Exchange\] linking Used Book Sellers, but is now owned by Amazon\). 

Sometimes price comparison can help - check out [isbns.net](http://www.isbns.net/) to find textbooks online: our textbooks are [here](https://www.isbns.net/isbn/9781442636224/) and [here](https://www.isbns.net/isbn/9781442636736/). Simply enter the ISBN and it will search online for all the different prices of that particular textbook. Be careful when buying books from the USA and UK since there might be added shipping and customs duties or shipment delays. The earlier you buy, the cheaper you can go generally. When I price checked the textbooks in May \(2020\), the cost was not significantly cheaper than buying from UTP directly. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
When buying the textbooks, be sure to double check the [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number)'s cited above \(ISBN = International Standard Book Number\). There are many different versions of the textbooks - different editions are printed at different times contain different text. Out textbook also comes in a  split version, since many universities might only offer half courses \(e.g. Early Medieval Europe\) instead of a full-year course. Don't get only half the textbook you will need...

If buying textbooks represents a financial hardship for you \(they are expensive, especially when you add up all the textbooks in all your courses\), please think about applying for a bursary \(a monetary award that is granted on the basis of financial need\) to help out with the cost. Carleton's office of Awards and Financial Aid provides a list of bursaries and instructions for [completing an application](https://carleton.ca/awards/bursaries/returning/). If the process seems overwhelming, [contact them directly](https://carleton.ca/awards/contact-us/) for help and they can coach you through the process.
