# Icebreaker

For our first week, we'll open with an activity to get to know each other. Imagine yourselves as if we're in class, awkwardly avoiding everyone's eyes in case you feel compelled to say hello or be social. 

Well! Channel that feeling of awkwardness into introducing yourself online, which is arguably just as weird to do as it is in person. Or maybe not for you born-digitals. 

1. Go to the Medieval Europe Team
2. Click on the "Week 2" Channel
3. Click on the "Files" in the task bar along the top
4. Find the "Virtual Name Tag Template" Word file and open it. 
5. It will open usually in the web browser version of Word. It will look a bit messed up, so click on the "Open in Desktop App".
6. It will then open on your desktop which will allow you to edit it properly. 
7. The first thing you should do \(BEFORE you change anything\) is to save the file with the title "firstname lastname - name tag" \(i.e. for me: Marc Saurette - Name Tag".
8. Then make changes. Save it. Then upload the file into Teams - you can just drag the file icon onto the open "Files" tab for the Week One channel.
9. Yay! You're done. Now go find someone who shares an interest with you \(a movie, a book etc.\) and say hello in Teams!
