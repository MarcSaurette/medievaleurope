# How to Join the Online Class

Our classes are scheduled take place on Tuesday from 1130 until 230.  

In reality, we will spend some of that time working together and some of that time working apart. It is key, however, you get various tools working as soon as possible so that we can all get online together. In the first week I will post a recorded welcome message and only the second week will we meet on Teams for the first time. In preparation for using Teams for videochatting, please follow the steps outlined below.

Having helped students and colleagues try to use Teams this summer, I know that it can be either easy to login or quite frustrating. The ratio seems to be about 50/50. So I am giving you the first week of class to figure it out/ get help with it. Please do not leave it to just before class on September 22nd to try to get it running!

1. Figure out your Carleton email, either by activating it for the first time or ensuring that you are able to use it. See [here for instructions](https://carleton.ca/its/all-services/email/carleton-student-email/). 
2. [Install Teams](digital-tools/teams/) on your computer and set it up. If at all possible don't use the browser version.
3. Make sure you are part of the "Medieval Europe" Team. 
4. If it doesn't pop up as an option in your Teams dashboard, click on the "Join or Create a Team" button and enter the code: **p3x08c8 .** This will only work if you are correctly logged in with your Carleton account. 
5. Find the general channel and text "hello" to tell us you're successfully logged in.
