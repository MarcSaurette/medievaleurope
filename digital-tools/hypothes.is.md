# Hypothes.is

[Hypothes.is ](https://hypothes.is)is a tool which allows you to annotate web content for your personal research use or, in our case, to allow us to collaborate as a group. It is, in essence, a digital version of you writing notes in the margins of a book/ photocopy. If you open a pdf in your browser, for example, you can annotate it and all your comments are saved in a central location. 

Annotation is an intellectual practice as old as reading. Take a look at Jason Jones' "[There are no new directions in annotations](https://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/jones/)" to understand this process. We see medieval manuscripts filled with annotations and it became such an accepted part of reading Christian, Jewish and Islamic holy books that whole traditions of glosses \(or authoritative commentary on sacred writing\) developed. Writing and sharing annotations became a way that much authoritative decisions about theology have been made. 

Take a look at this[ twelfth-century version](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0031/2r) of the Song of Songs \(_Cantus Canticorum_ in the Latin Vulgate Bible, translated from the Hebrew book שִׁיר הַשִּׁירִים at the end of the Tanakh\). The biblical text \(in darker brown ink in the centre of the page\) is much less than the commentary and explanatory text \(i.e. the "gloss"\) that surrounds it. This goes to show how much explanation can be necessary to make sense of a text. Mind you, it is a bit hard to explain how two lovers talking about each other's sexy bits is really about a soul searching for God's love .... Also notice how the artist has depicted the lovers as having very pale skin – striking when the women is described as "Black and beautiful" in the poem.

But back to our annotations.

Click [this link](https://hypothes.is/groups/N1oaroPY/hist2000-medieval-europe) to join the class annotation group. 

1. Play around with Hypothes.is. The first step is to view this page with the plugin activated, and **see the final instruction I have posted there**. You might also want to make a separate private folder for comments you want to keep to yourself \(or for each research project you are working on this year...\). 
2. For a sense of what hypothes.is can do, take a look at their [tutorials](https://web.hypothes.is/help-categories/tutorials/).
