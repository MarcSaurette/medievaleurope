# Hypothes.is

[Hypothes.is ](https://hypothes.is)is a tool which allows you to annotate web content for your personal research use or, in our case, to allow us to collaborate as a group. It is, in essence, a digital version of you writing notes in the margins of a book/ photocopy. If you open a pdf in your browser, for example, you can annotate it and all your comments are saved in a central location. 

Annotation is an intellectual practice as old as reading. Take a look at Jason Jones' "[There are no new directions in annotations](https://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/jones/)" to understand this process. We see medieval manuscripts filled with annotations and it became such an accepted part of reading Christian, Jewish and Islamic holy books that whole traditions of glosses \(or authoritative commentary on sacred writing\) developed. Writing and sharing annotations became a way that much authoritative decisions about theology have been made. 

Take a look at this[ twelfth-century version](https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0031/2r) of the Song of Songs \(_Cantus Canticorum_ in the Latin Vulgate Bible, translated from the Hebrew book שִׁיר הַשִּׁירִים at the end of the Tanakh\). The biblical text \(in darker brown ink in the centre of the page\) is much less than the commentary and explanatory text \(i.e. the "gloss"\) that surrounds it. This goes to show how much explanation can be necessary to make sense of a text. Mind you, it is a bit hard to explain how two lovers talking about each other's sexy bits is really about a soul searching for God's love .... Also notice how the artist has depicted the lovers as having very pale skin – striking when the women is described as "Black and beautiful" in the poem.

But back to our annotations.

5. Go back to the previous page \([https://web.hypothes.is/start/](https://web.hypothes.is/start/)\) and click to download the google chrome extension. Install it as your system requires. 

6. If you need to reopen Chrome after installing the hypothes.is extensions, do so and navigate to any webpage. You should now find the hypothes.is icon on your browser. You can click on the icon to start it up hypothes.is. 

![Click the hypothesis icon.](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-06-17-at-9.16.27-am.png)

7. It will open up a new sidebar. This is what mine looks like on a page I have already begun to annotate. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-06-17-at-9.28.08-am%20%281%29.png)

8. Hypothesis gives you three options to annotate. You can leave a comment on the page as a whole \(by clicking on page icon, or clicking on the words "Page Notes". 

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-06-17-at-9.56.05-am.png)

9. If you click on the eyeball \(?\) icon or click on the word "Annotations" it will take you to annotations on specific text. To make an annotation simply select some text and either highlight it or choose to make an annotation. A text box will open in the sidebar.

10. After you have entered your text be sure to press the "Post to ..." button, which makes the text available for others to see. You can also add tags in case you want to keep track of certain kinds of information to be searchable later.

11. Before you annotate anything, however, you will need to sign into hypothes.is again using your username and password by clicking on the person icon in the top right corner. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-06-17-at-9.36.21-am.png)

12. Then click [this link](https://hypothes.is/groups/N1oaroPY/hist2000-medieval-europe) to join the class annotation group. This is super important. We want you to post in a goup that we can find and that people don't see publicly \(which is the default\). The link will ask you to sign in again. 

![Join our group! It&apos;ll be fun!](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-06-17-at-9.44.24-am.png)

13. Then go back to the hypothes.is sidebar and on its top left corner you can select from "My Groups" i.e. where your annotations will appear. These are my choices - if you're using this for the first time your choices will be "Public" and "HIST2000 Medieval Europe". Select the second on the drop down menu. You'll notice that at the bottom of this drop down menu is the option to create a "New Private Group". If you want a group for annotations for doing research, you can create it and share it with others if you want.

14. Play around with Hypothes.is. The first step is to view this page with the plugin activated, and **see the final instruction I have posted there**. You might also want to make a separate private folder for comments you want to keep to yourself \(or for each research project you are working on this year...\).
