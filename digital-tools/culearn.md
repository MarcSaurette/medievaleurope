# cuLearn

[cuLearn](https://culearn.carleton.ca) is Carleton's LMS \(Learning Management Software\). It is the place, you will upload assignments \(unless you post them to [cuPortfolio](cuportfolio.md) or elsewhere\). CuLearn is generally where I post grades but since we're not really having grades first term we won't really use it at all. It is a bit clunky and I find its communication/ discussion system less than ideal, so we will try to use it as little as possible - using Teams for most functions. I don't recomment putting too much effort into using cuLearn since it'll be replaced by a new LMS in 2021. 

When I give you feedback on your work it will be via the private "chat" feature in Teams. 

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll notice that a lot of digital resources at Carleton are prefaced with a "cu" followed by a capitalized word. This was a branding decision of some years ago when people liked to talk about  "Web 2.0" in hushed tones. If you're wondering, the "cu" stands for Carleton University.
