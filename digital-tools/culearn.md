# cuLearn

[cuLearn](https://culearn.carleton.ca) is Carleton's LMS \(Learning Management Software\). It is the place, you will upload assignments \(unless you post them to [cuPortfolio](cuportfolio.md)\) and I will post grades for assignments for the term. It is a bit clunky and I find its communication/ discussion system less than ideal, so we will try to use it as little as possible - since other tools \(such as [Slack](teams/)\) are available at no cost. 

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll notice that a lot of digital resources at Carleton are prefaced with a "cu" followed by a capitalized word. This was a branding decision of some years ago when people liked to talk about the "Web 2.0" is hushed tones. If you're wondering, the "cu" stands for Carleton University.
