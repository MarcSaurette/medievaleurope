# Virtual MacOdrum Library

### Online Reserve Desk

ARES is Carleton University's electronic reserve desk. You can login in directly to [ARES](https://reserves.library.carleton.ca/ares/) through the library website, or through the link to the course readings in cuLearn. 

ARES is the place where any readings \(except for textbooks\) will be posted. You will need to login with your [MyCarletonOne password](https://carleton.ca/mycarletonone/) before being able to access the readings.

### VPN

VPN stands for Virtual Private Network – Carleton’s secure way of effectively “wrapping” your off-campus network connection in a Carleton blanket, so to speak. It encrypts \(protects\) all traffic and then routes it through Carleton before sending it back to you. By joining the Carleton VPN, you will be able to search the library, see online resources, or seamlessly use, for example, [scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com) much easier and save time.

Carleton's ITS has [different instructions](https://carleton.ca/its/help-centre/cat/vpn/) on how to install the university VPN on your particular operating system, including both computers and mobile devices. 

{% hint style="info" %}
A VPN forwards all your network traffic to the university network, which is where the benefits – like accessing local network resources remotely and bypassing Internet censorship – all come from. 

It also means that the university is aware how you are using your network connection \(and if you are doing so for nefarious reasons\). Thus, you might want to use the VPN connection only when you are doing research or work which benefits from it mimicking you being on campus.
