# Virtual MacOdrum Library

Normally MacOdrum would be the place to study, get books, maybe have a coffee. But this year MacOdrum will not be available in the same way. Currently \(as of August 24\), [MacOdrum has opened](https://library.carleton.ca/visit-building) to allow 50 students to use the main floor for individual \(not group\) study space. Books can be checked out via [curbsite pickup](https://library.carleton.ca/services/curbside-pick-and-mail-delivery-library-print-collection) \(limit of 10 items\).

### Online Reserve Desk

ARES is Carleton University's electronic reserve desk. You can login in directly to [ARES](https://reserves.library.carleton.ca/ares/) through the library website, or through the link to the course readings in cuLearn. ARES is the place where \(non textbook\) readings are posted in most classes, but we are using Perusall instead.

### VPN

VPN stands for Virtual Private Network – Carleton’s secure way of effectively “wrapping” your off-campus network connection in a Carleton blanket, so to speak. It encrypts \(protects\) all traffic and then routes it through Carleton before sending it back to you. By joining the Carleton VPN, you will be able to search the library, see online resources, or seamlessly use, for example, [scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com) as if you were on campus - which usually makes it much easier and quicker to do research.

Carleton's ITS has [different instructions](https://carleton.ca/its/help-centre/cat/vpn/) on how to install the university VPN on your particular operating system, including both computers and mobile devices. 

{% hint style="info" %}
A VPN forwards all your network traffic to the university network, which is where the benefits – like accessing local network resources remotely and bypassing Internet censorship – all come from. 

It also means that the university is aware how you are using your network connection \(and like your ISP, can see what you access\). Thus, you might want to use the VPN connection only when you are doing research or work which benefits from it mimicking you being on campus.
