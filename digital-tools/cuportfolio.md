# cuPortfolio

In HIST 2000, students will be asked to create a digital portfolio related to topics explored in the course. Using [**cuPortfolio**](https://cuportfolio.carleton.ca) (a digital platform that allows students to mount and exhibit their work), students will complete assignments as public presentations involving the analysis and interpretation of documents, images, or objects. Students will  be asked to share their work on cuPortfolio with other members of the class and provide helpful comments on their peers assignments (see [peer feedback](../syllabus/assignments/peer-feedback.md)). If cuPortfolio is new to you, you are responsible for making time to ramp up, troubleshoot, and learn how to use it. This activity will require your patience, can-do attitude, and sense of adventure.

Instruction and on-going support in using cuPortfolio will be provided by Dr. Saurette in first term. Additional support is available from the Education and Development Centre. For more on cuPortfolio, see [http://carleton.ca/cuportfoliosupport/](http://carleton.ca/cuportfoliosupport/)

4\. Scroll down the page and locate "Shared Collections". Find the Collection names "Your Name Here's Portfolio" and click on it.  Make sure the one you are clicking on is authored by me (Marc Saurette) not anyone else who copied the collection but forgot to rename it.

7\. You will be prompted to rename it. Make sure you rename it something like "Your Name's Portfolio...".

8\. You will be taken to the next page which will allow you to add pages to the collection. Don't do that at this point. Just scroll to the bottom of the page, confirm that there are the "Pages Already in the Collection" as in the following image and then press "Done".

![You're almost done. ](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2020-08-17 at 12.22.20 PM.png>)

9\. You now need to share you collection with the group (HIST2000 Medieval Europe). When you complete copying the collection or if you come back and edit the collection later, you can change sharing by clicking on "Share" in the upper left corner of an open page.&#x20;

![Click share!](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2020-08-17 at 12.47.43 PM.png>)

10\. Make sure the collection is shared with the whole class. Don't worry about "Advanced Share Options" just scroll to the bottom of the page, click on the "Share With" drop-down menu and find our class (HIST2000 Medieval Europe) and allow "Everyone in the Group" to view it.&#x20;

![Press "Save" and you're done!](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2020-08-17 at 12.47.53 PM.png>)
