# cuPortfolio

In HIST 2000, students will be asked to create a digital portfolio related to topics explored in the course. Using [**cuPortfolio**](https://cuportfolio.carleton.ca) ****\(a digital platform that allows students to mount and exhibit their work\), students will complete assignments as public presentations involving the analysis and interpretation of documents, images, or objects. Students will  be asked to share their work on cuPortfolio with other members of the class and provide helpful comments on their peers assignments \(see [peer feedback](../syllabus/assignments/peer-feedback.md)\). If cuPortfolio is new to you, you are responsible for making time to ramp up, troubleshoot, and learn how to use it. This activity will require your patience, can-do attitude, and sense of adventure.

Instruction and on-going support in using cuPortfolio will be provided by Dr. Saurette in first term. Additional support is available from the Education and Development Centre. For more on cuPortfolio, see [http://carleton.ca/cuportfoliosupport/](http://carleton.ca/cuportfoliosupport/)

### Here is a rough guide to getting started with cuPortfolio:

1. Sign in to [cuPortfolio](https://cuportfolio.carleton.ca).
2. Click on one of the many tabs to see "My Groups" and click on "HIST 2000".
3. On the Group page, locate collections and click on the collection "Saurette - HIST 2000 ...". Make sure the one you are clicking on is authored by me \(Marc Saurette\) not anyone else who copied the collection but forgot to rename it.
4. Locate the copy button on the right of the page. Click it, then click that you want to copy the collection, NOT the page. I think you will be prompted to rename it. I'm not sure. Just make sure you rename it something like "Your Name - HIST 2000 Portfolio...".
5. Press two more buttons, whose names I have forgotten at the bottom of the page \(something like "done"\).
6. Find the tab on the upper menu "Shared by me". Click on it.
7. Under the "Collections" locate your newly renamed collection. Click on the lock icon beside the name.
8. You will be brought to a new page entitled, "Share\|Edit Access". Locate the header "Shared with". Under the header "Share with" there should be a button "Share with". Click on that and then scroll down to HIST 2000 ... Fall 2020. And then press "Save".
9. Rejoice! You're done! Actually, now you should start working on your Profile.
