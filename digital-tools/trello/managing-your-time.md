# Managing your Time

There are different ways to work and if you're in university you've figured out some kind of system to get work done. If its not be a good system \(e.g. I can cram the night before and still pass"\), you might not be pleased with how you'll do this year. But university \(and life\) requires more of you as you go along. So if your work system seems to have stopped working, reflect a bit about how you work and what motivates you. 

### Case study: your professor

When I got to graduate school I \(Marc\) realized that I had few skills allowing me to tackle big projects. Sure, I was motivated to work when I arrived. I was used to receiving accolades from my undergraduate professors and thrived on positive feedback. But in graduate school, you don't get praise \(or at least I didn't, sigh\). The biggest compliment tended to be "You did an adequate job". So, I so found myself motivated by fear - fear of criticism or disapproval, fear of seeming stupid in front of my peers. And while I had classes to take, fear worked well to keep me on track. 

But there is a time in graduate when you aren't in classes, you don't see your supervisor for months on end and you just need to work on your own. Its a nice time of the degree – you need to read and think and read and think and read and think and then maybe write a little bit. My previous fear-based system and its Just-In-Time-Production model, did not work anymore. When I needed to write a 300-page dissertation, I didn't have a way to keep me working consistently. It was only then \(year 8 or so of university\) that I realized spending time proactively making a plan really helped. I got a whiteboard for brainstorming and covered my room in poster-sized sheets of paper filled with my scribbles. Sometimes I would wake up from a sleep and realized I had had a eureka moment in my dream - which I needed to jot down before I forgot what I had realized \(they were not always legible or rational...\). 

People today have loads of digital tools to keep track of deadlines and to help with project planning. It's never a great argument that "things will be easier if you do X now", but that is, I guess, the core of my reasoning. 

### Why worry about time management

When you have only a few things to do, you can usually keep track of them in your head. But in university there tend to be too many things to keep track of. I'm not sure if a pandemic is simplifying your life \(e.g. there are not jobs so you're working less now\) or making it more complex \(e.g. I used to be able to get all the books I need from the library in an hour and now it takes me days to track down sources I can access online/ via pickup\), but your lives are pretty filled with stuff. For many students, you can get away with little planning, in part because professors tend to outline work clearly and space it out in first and second year courses. But if you've ever found yourself surprised that an assignment is due the next day and you forgot about it, this is some evidence that you might be able to benefit from planning.

By planning your work, it will be easier to get it done. You don't spend time in existential angst wallowing about "What am I supposed to do" at the last minute, because, in advance \(and when not too stressed about the deadline\) you broke down the work into a series of tasks, that you can accomplish.

### Breaking work into tasks

There are many different ways to think about work. One of the hardest things about being a university student is that you are often vaguely told "Go write a paper" and are expected to know how to do that. In this class, we will provide some step-by-step instructions for doing some assignments, but as the course continues, we will tell you what to do less and less. The idea is that after you've done it once, you've been given the tools to do it again \(even if there are slightly different expectations and the project is different...\). The best thing for you to learn to do is to plan - i.e. to break down a project, such as writing an essay into a series of smaller actions to accomplish. [Trello](./) allows us a place to do so. 

A paper which asks you to analyze a primary source has a lot of steps \(many of which are outlined [elsewhere](../../practical-exercises/anatomy-of-a-primary-source/) on the course site\). The major steps are:

1. find the syllabus and read about the assignment again
2. find your course reader
   * where did you leave it?
   * Or, where folder did you put it in when I downloaded the e-book version
   * what did you rename it when you downloaded it 
3. Look through the reader
   * check the syllabus again for what primary sources you can write on
4. choose a primary source you want to talk about
   1. figure out what kind of topic you want to write about: women, war, wine, work?
   2. try to find sources that match you interest
5. read it
   1. read the words
   2. understand the words
   3. make sense of the source as a whole
6. Read other things to help you understand the source
   1. go to library catalogue
   2. search for information about the field
   3. identify useful articles/ books to consult
   4. acquire them
      1. download
      2. read online
      3. request and then pick up from library
   5. read them

      1. realize that half aren't useful \(return to the previous step\)
      2. feel like you understand what is going on in the source
7. Only at this point, do you actually start thinking about writing.

The important take away is that there are many many tasks which have to be accomplished before you can start to write an assignment. It is very helpful to take time to think through all the tiny steps you need to take before you get to work on your assignments. A good rule for breaking down your work into tasks is that each task can be done in 15-30 minutes. If your task likely will take longer than that, break down the task into further tasks.

### Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro technique is the practice of choosing one task and making the small commitment of using a timer and spending 25 minutes completely focused on that initiative, followed by short breaks.

Here’s how this technique, pioneered by Francesco Cirillo, works:

1. Choose a task to be accomplished.
2. Set a kitchen timer or Toggl for 25 minutes \(preferably, a tomato timer\).
3. Work on the task until 25 minutes is up.
4. Take a short five minute break \(this marks the completion of one "Pomodoro"\).
5. Repeat steps 1 to 4.
6. After every four pomodoros, take a longer break such as 20 minutes or more.
