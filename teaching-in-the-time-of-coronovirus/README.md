# Teaching in a Pandemic

{% hint style="info" %}
This year especially, life might be difficult for you. We are going to have a harder time picking up on this due since we're online. So, please, if you need some help \(in class, in life\) please reach out to us so we can do what we can or put you in contact with people who can.

Teaching and learning this year will be an experiment. I will be teaching with software I haven't used before and likely you will be learning in ways different than previous classes. And you might be using different software for each of your classes with professors demanding different forms of etiquette in each. Thus we need to all be extra patient and understanding when things don't go as smoothly as we'd like.

### Class Design

Given the uncertainty about the cyclical nature of the covid-19 pandemic, it is not clear at the time we are designing this course, what will be the exact teaching conditions of the upcoming academic year. We may be switching between face-to-face class time and online learning, so we have tried as best we could to make lectures, assignments and learning happen in either situation. 

We will all need to recognize that there may be some slight revisions to the course and its requirements if it turns out that not all of the elements we planned are amenable to the distance learning format, so please treat the syllabus more like an intended plan of action than a hard-and-fast legally-binding agreement. 

### Things to Keep in Mind

To succeed in the course, it may require more energy and discipline \(or at least different kinds\) from you than a traditional face-to-face course.

**Motivation**: Motivation can always be challenging. I suspect that in our context \(e.g. almost everyone has a lot of additional concerns/ issues/ considerations above and beyond the normal amount\) finding the motivation to buckle down on our courses might be extra challenging. Having even just a bit of live face-to-face time in the classroom \(especially with your peers\) can provide a surprising amount of energy and motivation… and you might be surprised by the impact of losing these moments. 

**Responsibility for learning**: In contrast to many first- and second-year courses, the bulk of the learning on online courses takes place autonomously -  e.g. while you are reading, analyzing and synthesizing the texts; producing your written assignments; critically engaging with lectures; class and small group discussions; etc. In this context, you will need to take even more responsibility for your own learning.

**Difficulty of concentration**: One of the reasons that I believe in-person classes remain so important, even in our online age, is because it gives us spaces in which we can switch off our devices and all of the distractions they offer, and hone the absolutely vital skill of concentration \(a skill that is vital both for having a successful learning experience in this course, but also for life in general\). Carving out spaces of intensive concentration \(while in class, doing your readings, working on your syntheses and other written assignments\) at home will no doubt be much more challenging, for a variety of reasons.

**Tech problems**: no doubt there will be both a significant learning curve for all of us in terms of how the various pieces of software work, as well as a variety of tech mishaps due to the demands of internet streaming, etc. We’ll have to become skilled at quickly problem solving these together.

### Advantages of Distance-Learning

It is also important to remember that the distance-learning model might also offer some positive opportunities – for example, offering many ways to participate in lectures – and try to take advantage of them. But it will still likely require more discipline and focus from us in order to truly benefit from them.

*  We will have slightly shorter lectures than normal, with frequent shifts of format \(eg Q+A, small group discussions\) and breaks to allow us to spend a few minutes away from the screen and then refocus. We will also have some dedicated time at the beginning and end of each class to discuss any logistical questions students might have.
* During lectures, there will be many ways to engage and show participation. For instance, we will have chat functions, a virtual whiteboard, and virtual small group breakouts. We have also revised and abridged the content, the set of assignments, and the schedule, in ways that should make the course easier to complete even in light of the various additional challenges students may face given the larger context.
