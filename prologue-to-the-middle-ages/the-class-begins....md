5. Complete this **background survey** to let me know more about you. 

### Overview:

The first week of class provides a transition back to school. This year the transition back to school also corresponds to a transition to online learning. This week asks you to focus on practical concerns, especially on getting used to the online environment we will be using in this class. 



Provide a short rationale for this week’s work suggesting its purpose in terms of the program of studies. \(Why we're doing this...\)

In our first week of class, we set out our ground rules for the class, highlighting:

* our plan for the course \(what will be covered\)
* expectations we have for students,

### **Online Time**

What will you focus on during your FaceTime with the students?

### Read/Watch/Listen

What do students need to read this week?

### Practice

Are there practical activities \(tasks, labs, fieldwork\), which students must do this week? If so, what are they and what specifically do they need to do, bearing in mind social-distancing?

### **Discuss**

What questions should students be discussing with each other on the discussion board for this course?

### **Do**

What quizzes \(if any\) or other activities should students complete this week to evaluate their own progress? How will they know they are “on track”?

### **Assess** 

Is there a graded assignment this week? If so, what is the assignment and when does it need to be submitted?

### Going Further

If students want to do more to ensure success, what materials and resources \(e.g. reading, video, audio simulations, games\) do you recommend?

### **Help**

 If a student is struggling, how should they seek help?
