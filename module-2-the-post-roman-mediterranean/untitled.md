# Successor Kingdoms

### Goals for this week

By the end of this week, what should students **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

### Overview:

Provide a short rationale for this week’s work suggesting its purpose in terms of the program of studies. \(Why we're doing this...\)

### **Online Time**

What will you focus on during your FaceTime with the students?

### Read/Watch/Listen

What do students need to read this week?

* \(optional\) You can watch an episode of a German documentary series \(presented in English here\) on the [_Germanic Peoples._](http://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=104730&xtid=144751) __Be critical as you watch it. While quite recently made, the history it tells is antequated. It is quite useful, however, for demonstrating how even academically-informed retellings of the Early Middle Ages can show only a partial picture. 

### Practice

Are there practical activities \(tasks, labs, fieldwork\), which students must do this week? If so, what are they and what specifically do they need to do, bearing in mind social-distancing?

### **Discuss**

What questions should students be discussing with each other on the discussion board for this course?

### **Do**

What quizzes \(if any\) or other activities should students complete this week to evaluate their own progress? How will they know they are “on track”?

### **Assess** 

Is there a graded assignment this week? If so, what is the assignment and when does it need to be submitted?

### Going Further

If students want to do more to ensure success, what materials and resources \(e.g. reading, video, audio simulations, games\) do you recommend?

### **Help**

 If a student is struggling, how should they seek help?
