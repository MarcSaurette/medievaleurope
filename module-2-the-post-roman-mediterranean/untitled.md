# Successor Kingdoms

### Goals for this week \(October 20th\)

By the end of this week, what should students **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

### Overview:

Provide a short rationale for this week’s work suggesting its purpose in terms of the program of studies. \(Why we're doing this...\)

### **Online Time**

What will you focus on during your FaceTime with the students?

### Read/Watch/Listen

What do students need to read this week?

* Rosenwein's textbook is organized chronologically, so that can read about three different regions \(Europe, Byzantium, Dar-al-Islam\) in temporal chunks. I'm asking you to take a read these chapters differently - this week, looking at "Europe" as a whole in chapters 2-4. 
* The primary sources you will read this week attempt to show the nature of politics during the early Middle Ages. 

  * extracts from the state papers \(_Variae_\) of Cassiodorus _\(_an advisor to Gothic kings\)
  * an extract from the _Life of Charlemagne_ by Einhard. 

* \(optional\) You can watch an episode of a German documentary series \(presented in English here\) on the [_Germanic Peoples._](http://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=104730&xtid=144751) __Be critical as you watch it. While quite recently made, the history it tells is antequated. It is quite useful, however, for demonstrating how even academically-informed retellings of the Early Middle Ages can show only a partial picture. 

### Practice

In this week's optional discussion group, Vanessa will highlight the most important steps to take in writing a document analysis paper – what information to focus on, what to ignore, and how to make it look just right!

### **Discuss**

In the readings, continue to think about and discuss how 

### **Do**

What quizzes \(if any\) or other activities should students complete this week to evaluate their own progress? How will they know they are “on track”?

### **Assess** 

Is there a graded assignment this week? If so, what is the assignment and when does it need to be submitted?

### Going Further

If students want to do more to ensure success, what materials and resources \(e.g. reading, video, audio simulations, games\) do you recommend?

### **Help**

 If a student is struggling, how should they seek help?
