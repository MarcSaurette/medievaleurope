# The Eastern Roman Empire

### Goals for this week

By the end of this week, what should students **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

* student will come to understand the continuing challenges and changes that happen over the course of the Early Middle Ages in the East Roman Empire \(they never did call themselves Byzantine, this is a modern term\). 

### Overview:

Provide a short rationale for this week’s work suggesting its purpose in terms of the program of studies. \(Why we're doing this...\)

### **Online Time**

What will you focus on during your FaceTime with the students?

### Read/Watch/Listen

Required:

* Rosenwein's textbook is organized chronologically, so that you can read about three different regions \(Europe, Byzantium, Dar-al-Islam\) in temporal chunks. I'm asking you to take a read these chapters differently - this week, looking at "Byzantium" as a whole in chapters 2-4.

Optional:

Kaldellis, Anthony. _Romanland. Ethnicity and Empire in Byzantium_. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2019. Pp. xvi, 373. The preface outlines his major thoughts. 

* "_Romanland_ is a brilliant, big-picture analysis of the highest caliber with a time frame stretching from the third to the eleventh century \(including some glimpses on late Byzantium\) and a geographical scope encompassing Italy, the Balkans, and Asia Minor. Kaldellis' text is bristling with stimulating observations and compelling arguments and invites us to rethink numerous well-established scholarly opinions. In a nutshell, the author aspires to demonstrate that the Byzantine Empire was neither "Byzantine" nor an"'empire," or at least what scholars traditionally consider to be a multiethnic imperial state. Byzantium, he argues, should be seen as a medieval Roman nation-state dominated by a largely homogeneous and clearly defined ethnic group, the Romans." \[Quoted from a review by Alexander Beihamme on _The Medieval Review._\]

Averil Cameron, Byzantine Matters. Princeton; Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2014. xiv, 164. ISBN 9780691157634.

* "Byzantine Matters is an assessment of the current state of Byzantine studies by a well-respected member of the field. Though a slender volume, its goals are ambitious—to understand the reasons for the marginalization of Byzantine studies in the Western academy and to offer a few prescriptions for its correction. Following a brief introduction, the book progresses as a series of essays on particular themes, close to the author’s personal interest, that she has examined in public lectures in recent years." \[From [Bynn Mar Classical Review](https://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2014/2014.08.60/) by George E. Demacopoulos\]



### Practice

Are there practical activities \(tasks, labs, fieldwork\), which students must do this week? If so, what are they and what specifically do they need to do, bearing in mind social-distancing?

### **Discuss**

What questions should students be discussing with each other on the discussion board for this course?

### **Do**

What quizzes \(if any\) or other activities should students complete this week to evaluate their own progress? How will they know they are “on track”?

### **Assess** 

Is there a graded assignment this week? If so, what is the assignment and when does it need to be submitted?

### Going Further

If students want to do more to ensure success, what materials and resources \(e.g. reading, video, audio simulations, games\) do you recommend?

### **Help**

 If a student is struggling, how should they seek help?
