# The Eastern Roman Empire

### Goals for this week

By the end of this week, what should students **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

* student will come to understand the continuing challenges and changes that happen over the course of the Early Middle Ages in the East Roman Empire \(they never did call themselves Byzantine, this is a modern term\).
* learn about the difficulties of studying the "Byzantine Empire" and how current scholars are reinterpreting a field still defined by  problematic 19th century interpretations of its history and significance \(e.g. the problem of modern nationalism\)
* write up a detailed analysis of a primary source

### Overview:

The Eastern Roman Empire \(aka Romanland/ Romania\) continues in various forms until the 15th century. We will explore aspects of its history, focussing on the reign of Justinian and Theodora, and the representation of imperial power in mosaic and chronicles.

### **Online Time**

On Tuesday November 3rd, we will consider why Constantine chose the small port city of Byzantium to be his new capital, how it is incorrect to talk about a Byzantine Empire \(but we will anyways\), and how a focus on Justinian tends to distract us from the challenges Byzantium will face after his death. 



### Read/Watch/Listen

**Required**:

* Rosenwein's textbook is organized chronologically, so that you can read about three different regions \(Europe, Byzantium, Dar-al-Islam\) in temporal chunks. I'm asking you to take a read these chapters differently - this week, looking at "Byzantium" as a whole in chapters 2-4. 

{% hint style="info" %}
What are the major events that Rosenwein addresses? If we look at Byzantine history represented in the textbook, what overarching story \(grand narrative\) about Byzantium is being told?
{% endhint %}

* The primary sources you will read this week attempt to show the nature of politics during the early Middle Ages. 
  * 

**Optional**:

Kaldellis, Anthony. _Romanland. Ethnicity and Empire in Byzantium_. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2019. Pp. xvi, 373. The **preface** outlines his major thoughts. 

* "_Romanland_ is a brilliant, big-picture analysis of the highest caliber with a time frame stretching from the third to the eleventh century \(including some glimpses on late Byzantium\) and a geographical scope encompassing Italy, the Balkans, and Asia Minor. Kaldellis' text is bristling with stimulating observations and compelling arguments and invites us to rethink numerous well-established scholarly opinions. In a nutshell, the author aspires to demonstrate that the Byzantine Empire was neither "Byzantine" nor an"'empire," or at least what scholars traditionally consider to be a multiethnic imperial state. Byzantium, he argues, should be seen as a medieval Roman nation-state dominated by a largely homogeneous and clearly defined ethnic group, the Romans." \[Quoted from a review by Alexander Beihamme on _The Medieval Review._\]

Averil Cameron, Byzantine Matters. Princeton; Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2014. xiv, 164. ISBN 9780691157634.

* "Byzantine Matters is an assessment of the current state of Byzantine studies by a well-respected member of the field. Though a slender volume, its goals are ambitious—to understand the reasons for the marginalization of Byzantine studies in the Western academy and to offer a few prescriptions for its correction. Following a brief introduction, the book progresses as a series of essays on particular themes, close to the author’s personal interest, that she has examined in public lectures in recent years." \[From [Bynn Mar Classical Review](https://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2014/2014.08.60/) by George E. Demacopoulos\]

### **Do** 

* The [Draft Document Analysis](../syllabus/assignments/critical-analyses.md#draft-document-analysis) paper is due on Monday, November 2nd by 10am. 

### Going Further

If students want to do more, they can read the optional reading assignments. 

There is also a three-part documentary series entitled [_Byzantium: Tale of Three Cities_](https://fod-infobase-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/p_Collection.aspx?seriesID=65390) \(requires login to library resources\) which traces the history of the Byzantine Empire through a focus on its capital city from its founding \(ep. 1\), its growth until the end of the Middle Ages \(ep. 2\) and its fall and transformation after 1453 \(ep. 3\). 

There is also a short documentary on the [Sassanids](http://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=104730&xtid=41274) \(the Byzantines major opponents before the rise of Islam\), you could watch. 

### **Help**

 If a student is struggling, how should they seek help?
