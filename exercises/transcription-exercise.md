# Transcription Exercise

Week 9. Transcription of Letter from Caesaria to Radegund. 

1. Read Eric Knibbs' "How to Use Modern Critical Editions of Medieval Latin Texts" on Perusall. 
2. Read the Joan Ferrante's translation of the Letter of Abbess Caesaria to Radegund
3. Compare the Latin text Ferrante includes at the bottom of the webpage, to the Latin edition given in the _Monumenta Germania Historica_. 
   * How do the Latin texts look different
   * In the MGH, the notes and introduction are also in modern \(neo-\)Latin. Why do you think the editors did that?
   * Can you make sense of the "scholarly apparatus" \(i.e. footnotes and marginal notes\)? What kinds of information do they seem to communicate?
4. Catalogue description of ms is here: [https://ccfr.bnf.fr/portailccfr/ark:/06871/004D02A14154](https://ccfr.bnf.fr/portailccfr/ark:/06871/004D02A14154) 
5. Bibliography and a link to a B&W reproduction of the manuscript is available here. This viewer is somewhat antequated and only works on some browsers, so I have added a pdf version of the first few pages and the letter to Radegund on Persuall.
