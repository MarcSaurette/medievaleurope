# Background Survey

When teaching face to face, I  always begin the year getting a sense of who students are, what is the background, why they decided to take the course etc. I want to know this information because it helps me understand how much or how little people already know about the Middle Ages. This year, I've decided to create a simple form to get feedback from all of you about this sort of information instead. 

Depending on how much you want to talk about yourself, it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to fill out. 

1. Click on this [link](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lRjZagbeXki8UfzhJsyFMOouN9xOcPBFmXXZx7xcRchUNDRINExLQldIWkNWQVdKN1pQT0ZPTEFMTCQlQCN0PWcu).
2. Fill in the questions.  
3. Click Submit. 

Thanks! I'll have other forms for you to fill out throughout the term that I'll post in different weeks!
