# Icebreaker

For our first week, we'll open with an activity to get to know each other. Imagine yourselves as if we're in class, awkwardly avoiding everyone's eyes in case you feel compelled to say hello or be social. 

Channel that potential feeling of awkwardness into introducing yourself online, which is arguably just as weird to do as it is in person. Or maybe not for you born-digitals...

1. Go to the Medieval Europe Team
2. Click on the "Week 1" Channel
3. Under "Posts", tell your professors and fellow students a little about yourself. Are you from Ottawa or elsewhere? Will you be in Ottawa or elsewhere during the school year? What are your favourite shows/ games/books/ music? 
4. Add a picture of yourself and add a GIF of how you think others see you.
5. Find someone who seems to share an interest and say hello in reply to their post!
6. I've already posted a cringeworthy sel- intro of myself to get the ball rolling.
