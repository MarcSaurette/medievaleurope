# The Transformation of Empire

### Goals for this week \(October 13th\)

By the end of this week, what should students **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

* understand how changes to the religious and cultural identity of Late Antiquity contributed to the existing structural problems of the Roman system, thereby encouraging decentralization/ fragmentation of power
* critique the "Migration Thesis" interpretation of European History, which locates modern nations in an idealized Germanic Past
* learn how to read against the grain with primary sources. We will read three sacred biographies \(hagiographies\), but we will ignore the authors' embedded arguments \(X was a saint\) to see what they say about Late Antique society in flux. 

### Overview:

This week we will explore the end of Late Antiquity, and the rise of two key forces that promoted then end of the existing Roman system around the Mediterranean: the rise of Christianity as an Imperial ideaology and the growing influence of the provinces \(aka the Barbarians\). These two trends lead to a weakening of traditional Roman elites and begin a process of fragmentation, which manifests itself first in division of Europe into kingdoms. 

### **Online Time**

On Tuesday, October 13th, we will address the figure of Constantine and his role in legitimizing Christianity \(and beginning its ascendence as an Imperial religion\). We will then address \(and largely reject\) the idea of the "Fall of Rome" at the hands of Barbarian hordes.

In our class, the professor will lecture and students will also break up into smaller groups to discuss the _Lives_ of three Late Antique Saints. We will then rejoin the main meeting to discuss what these texts written at the end of Antiquity tell us about contemporary attitudes to their changing times. 

### Read/Watch/Listen

* On Perusall, you will read and annotate a chapter from Chris Wickham's _The Inheritance of Rome_ which provides a detailed introduction to the questions we will be discussing in class. Wickham is one of the foremost scholars of the early medieval world today and in his other writings has questioned the received picture of the time period. Consider, as much as possible, how this chapter \(written for a popular and undergraduate audience\) differs from the briefer introduction in Rosenwein's textbook. 
* On Perusall, you will read and annotate the _Lives \(italicized because they are a genre\)_ of three Late Antique/Early Medieval people. Their lives \(i.e. lived experience\) were commemorated because of their holy reputation, but these _Lives_ \(the texts\) also give us a sense of the changing societies of the Fourth century CE \(and afterwards\). If you were to read these sources not \(as the authors intend\) as proof of their sanctity, but as evidence for social change, what clues exist in the narratives?

* \(Optional\): For more about Constantine's conversion you can watch this hour long documentary, [_The Conversion of Constantine_](http://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=104730&xtid=114960) produced by Arte France \(part of a larger series on the end of Antiquity\). 
  * **Description**: How and why did the emperor Constantine convert to Christianity during the Battle at the Milvian Bridge in 312? Was it a sincere personal decision or politically motivated? What were the advantages of converting? Though he chose Christianity, did Constantine continue to believe in the Sun God? Was the covenant between the Church and the Empire inevitable?
* \(Optional\) for more about the history of Constantine's city, you can watch [Byzantium: Tale of Three Cities](http://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?seriesID=65390&wID=104730) which traces the history of this city from Late Roman to Ottoman times. 

### Practice

In the optional discussion group, led by Vanessa, she will give general feedback about the latest assignment you submitted, and address more generally the question of "What is YOUR Middle Ages?"

### **Assess** 

In this week and the next, you will receive feedback on your first Critical Reponse \(which was due October 9th\). 

### Going Further

If you want to read Chris Wickham's magisterial redefinition of how to approach the early Middle Ages, read his _Framing the Middle Ages_ [available online throught the library](https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/1gorbd6/alma991022743263905153). A paper copy of _The Inheritance of Rome_ is also available for curbside pickup/mail from the Library if you want to read more. N.B. _Framing_ is meant for an audience of academics \(i.e. professors\) but _Inheritance_ is meant to be more introductory.  

### **Help**

 If you are feeling behind, or confused for what you need to be submitting and where, message Marc or Vanessa to organize a one-on-one meeting.
