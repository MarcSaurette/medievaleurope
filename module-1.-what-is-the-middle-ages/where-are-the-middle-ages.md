# Where are the Middle Ages?

### Goals for this week \(September 29, 2020\)

By the end of this week, what should students **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

* understand the fluidity to the geographic component of historical analysis
* learn how to access resources through the library

### Overview:

This week we will move from examing the Middle Ages as a temporal phenomenon \(a historical period\) to exploring its geographic definition. By understanding how medievalists are redefining the geographic extent of the "Medieval World", we will be able to nuance our idea of the Middle Ages.

* we will try to understand why academics write the way they do \(and why it is important for scholars to sometimes be obstuse\)
* we will read about the historiography of the "Global Middle Ages"
* we will seek to understand how the modern concept of the "National State" impacts how we view the past \(including the Middle Ages\)
* we will seek to understand how new research on economic, social, religious and cultural exchange binds together a much wider geographic area than is traditionally considered "Medieval"
* Presentation from Susan Tudin, History subject specialist at MacOdrum Library

### **Online Time**

From 11h30 until 13h00, the professor will speak about the traditional geographic definition of the "Medieval World" and how this has changed in the last decades. Students will be asked to consider their own inherited ideas about the Middle Ages to see where they place borders \(and why?\). 

From 13h15 unti 14h30, Susan Tudin, the History subject specialist, will lead a presentation on doing research in the library \(well, through the library, since it's all online these days...\)

### Read/Watch/Listen

Students will need to read and annotate:

* An article entitled, "Where are the Middle Ages" on a scholarly blog, the _Public Medievalist_, a copy of which is located on Perusall. 
* On Wednesday, we will read an academic article looking the idea of the Global Middle Ages on Perusall. In preparation, please read the description of the exercise [here](../exercises/anatomy-of-an-academic-article/):  

### Practice

* We will continue to practice using the Perusall social annotation tool on Wednesday. 

### **Discuss**

What questions should students be discussing with each other on Perusall this week?

* when reading and annotating the texts for this week, think about when and where you think the Middle Ages are located. Do the categories the academics use fit with how YOU see the time period?

### **Do**

* just everything else, I think...

### **Assess** 

This week you will receive feedback on the Profiles you created on cuPortfolio last week. 

### Going Further

If students want to prepare more they can sign up for [hypothes.is](../digital-tools/hypothes.is.md) and [zotero](../digital-tools/zotero.md). For joining the Medieval Europe Group Zotero group, you need to get approval which can take a few days. 

### **Help**

 If a student is struggling, how should they seek help?
