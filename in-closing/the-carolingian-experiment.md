# The End of the Early Middle Ages

### Goals for this week

By the end of this week, what should students **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

### Overview:

Provide a short rationale for this week’s work suggesting its purpose in terms of the program of studies. \(Why we're doing this...\)

### **Online Time**

What will you focus on during your FaceTime with the students?

### Read/Watch/Listen

What do students need to read this week?

* \(Optional\): Watch Professor Robert Bartlett's [introduction to the history of the Normans](http://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=104730&xtid=124970). He looks at how the Norse \(North-men\) become settled as Normans in Northern France. 
* \(Optional\) Watch a different version of the same story told in the documentary series, _Butterfly Effect_, which devotes an episode to [_Vikings: From Paris to Normandy_](http://proxy.library.carleton.ca/login?url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=104730&xtid=183497)_._

### Practice

Are there practical activities \(tasks, labs, fieldwork\), which students must do this week? If so, what are they and what specifically do they need to do, bearing in mind social-distancing?

### **Discuss**

What questions should students be discussing with each other on the discussion board for this course?

### **Do**

What quizzes \(if any\) or other activities should students complete this week to evaluate their own progress? How will they know they are “on track”?

### **Assess** 

Is there a graded assignment this week? If so, what is the assignment and when does it need to be submitted?

### Going Further

If students want to do more to ensure success, what materials and resources \(e.g. reading, video, audio simulations, games\) do you recommend?

### **Help**

 If a student is struggling, how should they seek help?
